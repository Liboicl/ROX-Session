			ROX-Session
			A very simple session manager
			by Thomas Leonard

TODO: Get sawfish's iconize animation to go into the middle of the screen
      so people stop blaming us for hiding the icons under the panel...

06-Mar-2002
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added XSetting for default Gtk+ font.

05-Mar-2002
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added settings for cursor blinking.

03-Mar-2002
~~~~~~~~~~~
Put choice of window manager in the options box, instead of having its own
system. The 'DefaultWM' file is no longer used.

01-Mar-2002
~~~~~~~~~~~
Changed over to Gtk+-2.0.

20-Feb-2002
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added instructions on using ROX-Session with gdm.
XSETTINGS now supports the Gtk/CanChangeAccels setting (requires Gtk patch).

03-Feb-2002
~~~~~~~~~~~
Started adding support for XSETTINGS protocol.

29-Jan-2002 (Release 0.1.13)
~~~~~~~~~~~
Removed session support, after realising that, despite its insane levels of
complexity, it doesn't actually support what I want (confirmation of logout)!
Updated configure.in for new autoconf (Richard Boulton).
Put in lots of quotes to cope with spaces in filenames.
Default .xsession no longer sets LD_LIBRARY_PATH, but does provide an easier
way to turn on anti-aliased fonts.

18-Oct-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
Started adding session management support.

04-Oct-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added IceWM to the default list of window managers (Bernard Jungen).

28-Jul-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added WindowMaker to the default list of window managers (Terol Jose).

16-May-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
Moved to new AppInfo.xml system.

23-Mar-2001 (Release 0.1.12)
~~~~~~~~~~~
When the window manager quits, the choice box defaults to the last used
command (so it's easy to restart the same program).

18-Mar-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
When first loaded, ROX-Session will ask you which window manager you want
to use. If the window manager you run dies (or is quit), ROX-Session will
ask again.
Errors from child processes are copied to standard error, as well as being
displayed in the log window.

13-Mar-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
'which' doesn't work on some systems. Try using 'twm' even if we think we
can't find it (Stephen Watson).

10-Mar-2001 (Release 0.1.11)
~~~~~~~~~~~
ROX-Session will now compile automatically the first time it is run.

09-Mar-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
The default login script now runs everything it finds in
`Choices/ROX-Session/AutoStart'. Symlink your applications into here to
get them starting automatically!

Added an AppMenu with 'Auto start...' which creates and opens the user's
AutoStart directory.

13-Jan-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
Bugfix: A extra copy of the error pipe was being passed to child processes,
	wasting one FD.

10-Jan-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
Now traps standard error output and displays it overlayed on the
desktop.

01-Jan-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
Improved the icon (slightly).

19-Dec-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Fixed a minor compiler warning (Bernard Jungen).

10-Nov-2000 (Release 0.1.10)
~~~~~~~~~~~
Fixed a bug which prevented ROX-Session from working under most systems:
waitpid() was called even though ROX-Session was ignoring child processes
(spotted by Stephen Watson).

07-Sep-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Fixed some bash-only problems (Bernard Jungen).
