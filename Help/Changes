			ROX-Session
			A very simple session manager
			by Thomas Leonard

10-Mar-2001 (Release 0.1.11)
~~~~~~~~~~~ 
ROX-Session will now compile automatically the first time it is run.

09-Mar-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
The default login script now runs everything it finds in
`Choices/ROX-Session/AutoStart'. Symlink your applications into here to
get them starting automatically!

Added an AppMenu with 'Auto start...' which creates and opens the user's
AutoStart directory.

13-Jan-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
Bugfix: A extra copy of the error pipe was being passed to child processes,
	wasting one FD.

10-Jan-2001
~~~~~~~~~~~
Now traps standard error output and displays it overlayed on the
desktop.

~~~~~~~~~~~
Improved the icon (slightly).

19-Dec-2000
~~~~~~~~~~~
Fixed a minor compiler warning (Bernard Jungen).

10-Nov-2000 (Release 0.1.10)
~~~~~~~~~~~
Fixed a bug which prevented ROX-Session from working under most systems:
waitpid() was called even though ROX-Session was ignoring child processes
(spotted by Stephen Watson).

~~~~~~~~~~~
Fixed some bash-only problems (Bernard Jungen).
