			ROX-Session
			Session manager for the ROX desktop
			by Thomas Leonard

06-Sep-2004 (Release 0.1.25)
~~~~~~~~~~~
Use new ROX-Lib system for getting root access (Thomas Leonard).

30-Aug-2004
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added support for changing Xcursor theme and size (Guido Schimmels; code from
GNOME).

25-Aug-2004
~~~~~~~~~~~
Give a more helpful message if the backup xsession file already exists
(requested by Nils-Erik Svangård).

14-Aug-2004 (Release 0.1.24)
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added support for D-BUS 0.22; 0.20 and 0.21 are still supported (Thomas
Leonard).

08-Aug-2004
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added support for switching mouse button order for left-handed use (Guido
Schimmels; code from GNOME).

22-Jul-2004
~~~~~~~~~~~
Compatability fixes: /bin/sh behaviour, DPMS, availability of long options
(Stephen Watson).

01-Jul-2004
~~~~~~~~~~~
Message log sizing/positioning code takes Xinerama into account and window is
now a top-level window instead of a dialogue (Tony Houghton).

Provides options for DPMS and keyboard auto-repeat, which can be set via
exteral applications (Tony Houghton).

Added /etc/X11/dm/Sessions to the list of locations where rox.desktop can be
installed (for Mandrake systems).

11-Jun-2004
~~~~~~~~~~~
Bugfix: Setting the keymap to an empty string produced a crash.

05-Jun-2004 (Release 0.1.23)
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added setting to control keymap (Guido Schimmels).

19-May-2004
~~~~~~~~~~~
Bugfix: AutoStart didn't get ROX-Filer from Zero Install (reported by Stuart
	Langridge).

18-May-2004
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added French translation (Sébastien Person).

09-May-2004
~~~~~~~~~~~
Removed window manager chooser from options box. The new way to set the
window manager is by changing an XSetting via D-BUS. A simpler fallback
text entry box is provided for emergencies, and ROX-Session will try to
pick a default window manager automatically in all cases now.

The idea here is that clicking on a window manager (like OroboROX) in
ROX-Filer will switch to that window manager.

07-May-2004
~~~~~~~~~~~
Updated Dutch translation (Jan Wagemakers).

08-Apr-2004
~~~~~~~~~~~
Use a different test for a locally installed ROX-Filer (Taco Buitenhuis).
The previous one didn't work on some systems.

04-Apr-2004
~~~~~~~~~~~
When using Zero Install, get default choices from there so you get default run
actions for archives, text files, web pages, etc.
If the Python D-BUS bindings aren't found, give a more helpful error message.

23-Apr-2004 (Release 0.1.22)
~~~~~~~~~~~
Start ZeroProgress (Zero Install progress monitor) on login, if Zero Install
is being used. Use OroboROX as the default window manager, if available.

22-Apr-2004
~~~~~~~~~~~
Improved icon (Jonatan Liljedahl).

21-Apr-2004
~~~~~~~~~~~
Use a GtkScrolledWindow for the message log, so that the mouse wheel works
(Tristan McLeay).
Added Zero Install version of OroboROX to window manager list.

20-Apr-2004
~~~~~~~~~~~
Moved the Logout dialog box and the setup dialogs out of the main ROX-Session
program and into Python scripts. Made the setup dialogs a bit more friendly,
and allow installing ROX on the session manager list.

13-Apr-2004
~~~~~~~~~~~
Guide will get ROX-Filer through Zero Install if there's no local copy
(reported Taco Buitenhuis).

11-Apr-2004
~~~~~~~~~~~
Removed XSettings from GUI. Instead, a new D-BUS interface can be used to
change the settings from external programs.

10-Apr-2004
~~~~~~~~~~~
Start a session D-BUS daemon running on login, if one isn't running already.
Added 'Session Settings...' to app menu (uses dbus to send the request to
the master ROX-Session process).

05-Apr-2004
~~~~~~~~~~~
Updated Spanish translation (Marcelo Ramos).

03-Apr-2004
~~~~~~~~~~~
Allow Styles to be read from ~/Choices so the user can customize it

01-Nov-2003
~~~~~~~~~~~
Updated Dutch translation (Jan Wagemakers).

26-Oct-2003
~~~~~~~~~~~
Use apsymbols.h (from autopackage.org) if possible for binary compatibility
with older glibc versions. Use g_ascii_* functions instead of the ctypes ones
for the same reason.

12-Oct-2003 (Release 0.1.21)
~~~~~~~~~~~
Run ROX-Filer via Zero Install, if possible. Also, try to get the MIME database

freezing X (Keith R. John Warno).

17-Apr-2003
~~~~~~~~~~~
Added note in RunROX explaining the need for -n (suggested by Keith R. John
Warno).

17-Apr-2003 (Release 0.1.19)
~~~~~~~~~~~

complexity, it doesn't actually support what I want (confirmation of logout)!

command (so it's easy to restart the same program).

~~~~~~~~~~~
When first loaded, ROX-Session will ask you which window manager you want
to use. If the window manager you run dies (or is quit), ROX-Session will
ask again.
Errors from child processes are copied to standard error, as well as being
displayed in the log window.

13-Mar-2001

~~~~~~~~~~~
