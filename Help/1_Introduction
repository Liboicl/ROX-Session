			A very simple session manager

			Introduction

Brief
~~~~~
ROX-Session is a simple and easy to use session manager. It is part of the
ROX project, but can also be used on its own. ROX project home:

What's a session manager?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Most people use a program such as xdm (X Display Manager) to control their
X server. xdm displays a graphical login prompt, logs you in, starts your
X session and then, afterwards, resets the X server and does it again.

How does xdm know when you've finished?

Well, after xdm has verified your user name and password it runs a system-wide
Xsession script as you. Try 'locate xdm/Xsession' to find the file on your
system.  When this script exits xdm resets the X server and restarts the login
process.

What does the Xsession script do?

It depends on your system, but usually it looks for an executable file called
'.xsession' in your home directory (note - as the name starts with a dot it is
hidden by default). If it finds one it runs it, otherwise it does some default
stuff. Your '.xsession' script runs all the programs you want running on
startup (such as a window manager, filer, xterm, etc). It runs all of these
programs in the background except the last one, which it execs. Here's a
simple example script (remember to make it executable!):

	twm &
	xclock &
	exec xterm

This runs the (horrible) twm window manager and xclock in the background. It
then replaces itself with the xterm process. You can now kill twm and xclock
as you please, but when xterm quits your session is over. In this example,
xterm is your session manager. Using xterm as a session manager isn't very
smart...

Many people use a window manager as a session manager. However, this has a
couple of drawbacks:
1) You can't change your window manager without restarting your X session.
2) Window managers are quite complex programs and can crash from time-to-time.
   If your session manager crashes then your X session is over!

What does ROX-Session do?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Very little. When you run it from your '.xsession' file it just loads and
waits. It doesn't draw anything on the screen. When you want to log out you
simply run it a second time. The new copy sees that the first one is running
and sends it a message. The first copy displays a box confirming that you want
to log out and, if you say yes, quits. This causes your X session to be
terminated. Save your data before logging out!!

Example .xsession file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	enlightenment &
	<path>/ROX-Filer/AppRun -b ~/Iconbar &
	exec <path>/ROX-Session/AppRun

Replace the <path>s with paths to ROX-Filer and ROX-Session. You will need
to have enlightenment (http://www.enlightenment.org), ROX-Filer
(http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~tal197) and ROX-Session on your system for the
above to work.


!!!WARNING!!!

	An incorrect .xsession file can prevent you from logging in!
	Make sure you test it first, or are able to get a textual login
	if needed (Ctrl-Alt-F1 on Linux, or try pressing F1 instead of
	Return at the xdm prompt for a 'failsafe' xsession script).
