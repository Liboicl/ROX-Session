      <h1>The ROX Guidebook</h1>
      <h2>First login</h2>
      <p>Welcome to ROX! If you've just logged in for the first time, you
should see a panel along the bottom of the screen and a plain grey
background (the 'pinboard').</p>
      <p>Both the pinboard and the panel are used to load files and
applications. ROX-Session creates a panel for you the first time
you log in:</p>
      <p align='center'>
        <img src='panel1.png'></p>
      <p>From left to right, this default panel provides access to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your home directory, where you save any files you create.</li>
        <li>Your 'Apps' directory, where your programs are kept.</li>
        <li>Any removable drives, such as CDROMs and floppy drives that
ROX-Session happened to notice. Don't worry if it missed some!</li>
        <li>This guide.</li>
        <li>ROX-Session itself (on the far right). Use this to logout.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When you have logged in for the first time, only three programs
will be running: ROX-Session, which sets things up for you;
ROX-Filer, which displays the pinboard and panels; and a window
manager. The window manager draws the titlebar and other
decorations around windows, allowing you to move and resize
them.</p>
      <h2>Exploring the filesystem</h2>
      <p>Click on your home directory to open a ROX-Filer window. This is
the place to save any documents you create. In fact, it's normally
impossible to save files anywhere else, so you can't easily lose
stuff.</p>
      <p>The titlebar of the window shows which directory you're looking
at. It currently shows '~', which is a short-hand for your home
directory. Your personal home directory is inside the main '/home'
directory, which contains home directories for all users of the
computer.</p>
      <p>Use the Up arrow on the toolbar to move into '/home', and you'll
see your personal directory listed alongside those of the other
users.</p>
      <p>If you go Up again you'll reach the root directory ('/'), which
contains everything in your system. You can't go up any further
from here.</p>
      <p>Click on the the 'home' icon to return to /home and then click
on your home directory to get back to where you started from. You
can also get back here by clicking on the picture of a house in the
toolbar.</p>
      <h2>Creating files and directories</h2>
      <p>Make sure you're in your home directory. Click Menu (the right
mouse button) over the filer window and choose New Directory from
the menu. Replace the selected sample name 'NewDir' with a suitable
name, such as 'Tutorial' and click on the Create button to create
the directory:</p>
      <p align='center'>
        <img src='newdir.png'></p>
      <p>The new directory will appear inside your home directory. Click
on it to see inside. Use directories to organise your files. You
can create more directories inside this one if you want, as many
levels deep as seems useful.</p>
      <p>We'll be using this directory several times in this tutorial. To
make it easier to get to we can put it on the panel. Click on the
Up button to return to your home directory and drag the Tutorial
directory onto the blank area in the middle of the panel. The panel
will highlight the empty space as you drag over it, showing you
whether the directory will be added to the left or right side of
the panel.</p>
      <p>You can now click on Tutorial on the panel to open it quickly.
Note that the directory is still inside your home directory. It has
not moved to the panel; the panel is merely a quick way to get to
it.</p>
      <p>In fact, we can make it even quicker to access than that. Click
Menu over the Tutorial icon on the panel and choose 'Edit Item'.
There is an area marked '(click to set)' in the keyboard shortcut
section of the box. Click on it and press Control+F1 (hold down the
Control key and tap F1, then release Control). The new shortcut
appears in the button:</p>
      <p align='center'>
        <img src='shortcut.png'></p>
      <p>After clicking on OK to accept the change, you can open the
tutorial directory at any time by pressing Control+F1.</p>
      <p>You can drag any file, directory or application onto the panel,
and you can use this method to set a shortcut to load or open each
one. For example, you can now set shortcuts to open your home
directory or see this guide.</p>
      <h2>Using CDs and floppy disks</h2>
      <p>To access any kind of removable media you need to 'mount' it, so
that it appears in the filesystem. There are a number of preset
mount points (set in the file /etc/fstab). ROX-Filer shows these
directories with a small circle on them.</p>
      <p>After inserting a disk in the drive, click on the mount point
directory to mount the device. The circle will go bright green to
indicate that something is mounted there:</p>
      <p align='center'>
        <img src='mount.png'></p>
      <p>Be sure to unmount the device before removing the disk!
ROX-Filer will offer to unmount the device when you close the
window, or you can choose Unmount from the menu.</p>
      <p>You can drag any files into another directory to copy them. You
may drag to directory windows, or into directories on the panel or
onto applications. See the ROX-Filer manual for more information
about handling files.</p>
      <h2>Running programs</h2>
      <p>If you've got some ROX applications already installed then you
can run them by clicking on 'Apps' to open the directory containing
them and then clicking on them to run them:</p>
      <p align='center'>
        <img src='apps.png'></p>
      <p>If you're still in the middle of installing things, you can open
a terminal instead. Click the right mouse button over the main area
in any filer window and choose 'Xterm here' from the 'Window'
submenu.</p>
      <p>You can now type the name of a program to run it. For example,
'gimp' (a graphics package) or 'galeon' (a web browser).</p>
      <p>You can get more ROX software from the ROX website:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a shape='rect' href='http://rox.sf.net/software.php3'>ROX
software list</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Finding documentation</h2>
      <p>You can see the help files provided by any ROX application by
bringing up a menu over its icon in a filer window (or panel) and
choosing Help from the menu.</p>
      <p>Try it now with ROX-Session (Menu click on the EXIT icon on the
far right of the panel; Help is on the 'Session' submenu). A filer
window opens providing access to all the help files:</p>
      <p align='center'>
        <img src='help.png'></p>
      <p>The Changes file lets you find out what features have been added
in each new version, and the README provides more detailed
information about ROX-Session than this guide.</p>
      <p>And, of course, this guide is itself included in ROX-Session's
help files. If you remove the guide from the panel, you can still
access it from here instead, or drag it back to the panel.</p>
      <p>ROX-Filer also has a large amount of documentation. Click on the
Help icon in the toolbar of any filer window to see it, or locate
the ROX-Filer application in a filer window and use the menu as
above.</p>
      <h2>Logging out</h2>
      <p>When you've finished using the computer for a while, click on
ROX-Session (the EXIT logo at the far right of the panel). The
dialog that appears allows you to return to the login screen or
shutdown the computer. You can also put the computer into a
low-power mode from here:</p>
      <p align='center'>
        <img src='logout.png'></p>
      <p>ROX-Session is running the whole time you are logged in. As well
as automatically running other programs (such as ROX-Filer and the
window manager), ROX-Session can be used to configure settings that
affect the whole desktop, such as the mouse speed or the default
font.</p>
      <p>Click on the Session Settings button to see all your options.
Note that the pinboard and panel are managed by ROX-Filer, so you
must use ROX-Filer's options to control them.</p>
