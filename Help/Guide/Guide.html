      <h1>The ROX Guidebook</h1>
      <h2>First login</h2>
      <p>Welcome to ROX! If you've just logged in for the first time, you
should see a panel along the bottom of the screen and a plain grey
background (the 'pinboard').</p>
      <p>Both the pinboard and the panel are used to load files and
applications. ROX-Session creates a panel for you the first time
you log in:</p>
      <p align='center'>
        <img src='panel1.png'></p>
      <p>From left to right, this default panel provides access to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your home directory, where you save any files you create.</li>
        <li>Your 'Apps' directory, where your programs are kept.</li>
        <li>Any removable drives, such as CDROMs and floppy drives that
ROX-Session happened to notice. Don't worry if it missed some!</li>
        <li>This guide.</li>
        <li>ROX-Session itself (on the far right). Use this to logout.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When you have logged in for the first time, only two programs
will be running. ROX-Session, which sets things up for you, and
ROX-Filer, which displays the pinboard and panels. You should
have been prompted to choose a window manager, which will
now also be running. The window manager draws the titlebar
and other decorations around windows, allowing you to move
and resize them.</p>
      <h2>Exploring the filesystem</h2>
      <p>Click on your home directory to open a ROX-Filer window.
This is the place to save any documents you create. In fact,
it's normally impossible to save files anywhere else, so you
can't easily lose stuff.</p>
      <p>The titlebar of the window shows which directory you're looking at.
It currently shows '~', which is a short-hand for your home directory.
Your personal home directory is inside the main '/home' directory, which
contains home directories for all users of the computer.
</p>
      <p>Use the Up arrow on the toolbar to move into '/home', and
you'll see your personal directory listed alongside those of
the other users.</p>
      <p>If you go Up again you'll reach the root directory ('/'), which
contains everything in your system. You can't go up any further
from here.</p>
      <p>Click on the the 'home' icon to return to /home and then click
on your home directory to get back to where you started from.
You can also get back here by clicking on the picture of a house
in the toolbar.</p>
      <h2>Running programs</h2>
      <p>If you've got some ROX applications already installed then you
can run them by clicking on 'Apps' to open the directory
containing them and then clicking on them to run them:</p>
      <p align='center'>
        <img src='apps.png'></p>
      <p>If you're still in the middle of installing things, you can open a
terminal instead. Click the right mouse button over the main
area in any filer window and choose 'Xterm here' from the
'Window' submenu.
</p>
      <p>You can now type the name of a program to run it. For example,
'gimp' (a graphics package) or 'galeon' (a web browser). You
can use this web browser window to visit<a href='http://rox.sf.net'> the ROX desktop website </a>and download more stuff from there.</p>
