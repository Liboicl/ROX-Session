      <h1>The ROX Guidebook</h1>
      <h2>Part II</h2>
      <p>Welcome back to the tutorial! In this part, we'll look at using
some of the standard ROX applications.</p>
      <h2>Edit</h2>
      <p>Click on 'Apps' on the panel and click on the 'Edit'
application, if you see it. If Edit isn't installed yet, you'll
need to fetch it from the ROX website. You may also need to install
ROX-Lib, a 'library' of shared code used by several other programs,
including Edit. Edit will warn you if ROX-Lib isn't installed.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a shape='rect' href='http://rox.sf.net/edit.php3'>Edit</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a shape='rect' href='http://rox.sf.net/rox_lib.php3'>ROX-Lib</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p align='center'>
        <img src='edit.png'></p>
      <p>You can now enter some text to experiment with. Clicking on the lifebelt
icon (the right end of the toolbar) will show you Edit's help files. You can
also see these by bringing up the menu over Edit in the filer window and
choosing Help, as before.</p>
      <p>Clicking Menu (the right mouse button) over the text will open
Edit's main menu. You can choose Options from here to change
the current font or colours used to display files.</p>
      <h2>Saving from Edit</h2>
      <p>To save your sample file, click on the disk icon in the toolbar, or
choose Save from the menu. A save box will appear, which looks
rather like the 'New Directory' box seen earlier. Choose a name
for your new file and drag the icon to a filer window (just as if
you were copying a file from a directory).</p>
      <p>In this case, we'll save to the Tutorial directory created in Part I.
Press the shortcut you set then (eg, Control+F1) or click on the
Tutorial directory to open it. Drag the picture of the text file
into the directory. You could also have dragged directly to the
Tutorial directory on the panel.</p>
      <p align='center'>
        <img src='save.png'></p>
      <h2>Loading files</h2>
      <p>If you now close the Edit window, you can reload the saved file by
dragging it back from the Tutorial directory onto Edit's icon. To make this
easier, drag Edit from your Apps directory onto the panel.</p>
      <p>If you'll often want to load text files into Edit, you can make Edit
the default run action. Bring up the menu over the saved text
file and choose 'Set Run Action' from the File submenu. Then,
drag Edit (eg, from the panel) onto the marked area:</p>
      <p align='center'>
        <img src='runaction.png'></p>
      <p>Clicking on any text file will now open it in Edit.</p>
